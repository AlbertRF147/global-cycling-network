## Frontend dev test for GCN

This is my submission for the dev test proposed by GCN. To run it:

- Clone the repo locally
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run start`

Important notes:

- Due to CORS issues with the server (https://www.globalcyclingnetwork.com/api/devtask), I could not fetch the data from my localhost app. Instead, the data is static in a file.
- The footer is a screengrab due to time constraints.
- The search bar displays a mock up (screengrab) of what in a future build would be suggestions and recommendations based on previous search history.

_Note: this code is not for production_
